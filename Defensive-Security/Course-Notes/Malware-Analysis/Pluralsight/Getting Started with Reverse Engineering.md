## Introduction

Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) - assembly language, lowest level, telling CPU how to operate.
Static vs Dynamic analysis. 

Workflow example > malicious file > basic analysis > advanced analysis (ida) > reporting and documentation > find next sample
code obfuscation may be used to slow down analysis , but not fully covered in this training. 

## Assemby Basics

CPU Architecture 
executing of exe: program on disk --os loader--> primary memory <--fetch--> decode by CPU 
CPU core is responsable for executing instructions, multiple cores allow for execution of multiple instructions.
CPU clock speed indicates the number of instructions that can be executed per second.

Layers of memory
1) CPU Registers <- programs prefer registers than other layers of memory
2) Caches
3) Primary Memory (RAM)
4) Secondanry storage
5) Input devices

32 bit systems have 8 general purpose registers:
32 bits:         EAX:EBX:ECX:EDX:ESI:ESI:ED:EBP:ESP
Lower 16 bits:   AX:BX:CX:DX:SI:DI:BP:SP
Lower 8  bits:   AL:BL:CL:DL
Upper 8 bits:    AH:BH:CH:CL

64 bit extends 32 general purpose registers and adds 8 more registers:
64 bits:    RAX:RBX:RCX:RDX:RSI:RDI:RBP:RSP
Net64: R8 - R15 32: R8D Lower16: R8W: Lower8: R8B
i.e RAX (64 bit can contain 64 0's or 1's)

Pointers
32B / 64B
EIP / RIP - instruction pointer (tells cpu where to look in memory)
ESP / RSP - stack pointer (keeps track of the top of stack in memory)
EBP / RBP - base pointer (space in stack for args and vars)

Index registers (commonly used for copy operations, moved from source to dest)
32B / 64B
ESI / RSI - Soruce index
EDI / RDI - Destination index

EFLAGS & RFLAGS (show results for operations i.e. + )
flags can be checked and editied during debugging. 
Carry flag - CF
Zero flag - ZF
sign flag - SF
trap flag - TF
direction flag - DF
overflow flag - OF
